def traversal(start_vertex, graph):
### This unified algorithm takes a graph, a start_vertex part of this graph, 
### and performs graph traversal using a queuing structure. 
### The algorithm returns the list of explored_vertices, and a 
### routing table to navigate the graph. 

  ## First we create either a LIFO a FIFO
  queuing_structure = new_queuing_structure() 
  ## Add the starting vertex with NULL as parent
  queuing_structure.push(start_vertex, NULL) 
  ## Initialize the outputs 
  explored_vertices = [] 
  routing_table = {} 
  while queuing_structure is not empty:
    
    ## This will return the next vertex 
    ## to be examined,and the choice of queuing structure will 
    ## change the resulting order. 
    
    (current_vertex, parent) = queuing_structure.pop() 
    
    ## Tests whether the current vertex is
    ## in the list of explored vertices
    if not (current_vertex in explored_vertices): 
       ## Mark the current_vertex as explored
       explored_vertices.push(current_vertex) 
       
       ## Update the routing table accordingly
       routing_table[current_vertex] = parent 
       
       ## Examine neighbors of the current vertex
       for neighbor in neighbors(graph, current_vertex): 
    	   ## We push all unexplored neighbors to the queue
           if neighbor not in explored_vertices:              
              queuing_structure.push(neighbor, current_vertex)
